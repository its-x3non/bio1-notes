**ğŸŸ¦(text)ğŸŸ¦** = Important

## What is Science?
- The word <u>science</u> comes from the Latin verb -> "To Know"
- <b>ğŸŸ¦Body of KnowledgeğŸŸ¦</b>
- <b>ğŸŸ¦Process of <u>Inquiry</u>ğŸŸ¦</b> by which we come to discord and better understand the natural world.
	- Involves asking <b>ğŸŸ¦questionsğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Involves making <b>ğŸŸ¦observationsğŸŸ¦</b> or <b>ğŸŸ¦measurementsğŸŸ¦</b>

## What can Science do?
- Provides <b>ğŸŸ¦explanationsğŸŸ¦</b> of the <u>natural world</u>
	- Natural world can be observed / measured
	- Cannot study/explain the supernatural
- Explanations are <b>ğŸŸ¦testableğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Collect evidence
- Explanations are <b>ğŸŸ¦falsifiableğŸŸ¦</b>
- Outgoing process -> conclusions are <b>ğŸŸ¦tentativeğŸŸ¦</b>

## What is biology?
- **Biology** is the scientific study of <b>ğŸŸ¦lifeğŸŸ¦</b>
- What constitutes as living?
	- The phenomenon of life seems to defy a simple, one-sentence definition
	- We recognize life mainly by what living things do.

## Properties of Life
1) <b>ğŸŸ¦Ordered OrganizationğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Unicellular 
		1) Bacteria
		2) Protist
			- Prokaryotes - No nucleus
				- No organelles
				- Smaller in Size
	- Multicellular 
		1) Animals
		2) Plants
		3) Fungi
			- Eukaryotes - Has a membrane bound nucleus
				- Compartments
				- Organelles
				- Larger in Size
2) Achieve homeostasis - Stable Internal Environment <b>ğŸŸ¦(Regulate Internal Environment)ğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Cold-blooded (Ectoderm) - Organisms that are <u>dependent</u> on the environment to achieve homeostasis.
		- Examples: Reptiles, amphibians, fish
	- Warm-blooded (Endotherm) - Organisms that don't depend on environment to achieve homeostasis.
		- Examples: Mammals, birds
3) <b>ğŸŸ¦Growth and DevelopmentğŸŸ¦</b>
4) Process <b>ğŸŸ¦(Energy Processing (Metabolism))ğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Cellular Respiration - Get energy from foods we eat
	- Photosynthesis - Convert sunlight to energy
5) Response to stimuli in environment <b>ğŸŸ¦(Response to the Environment)ğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Anything that elicit a response
6) <b>ğŸŸ¦ReproductionğŸŸ¦</b>
	1) Mitosis
		- No Partners
		- Offspring is exact copy of parent (identical)
	2) Meiosis
		- Partner involved
		- Genetic variability
7) <b>ğŸŸ¦Evolution (Adapt)ğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Process of change of time

## Diversity of Life
- Of all species that have been **identified & named:**
	- At least 290k are plants
	- 52k are vertebrates (animals with backbones)
	- 1 Million are insects (more than half of all known forms of life)
	- Estimates of the total number of species range from 10 million to over 100 million species

- Three domains of Life:
	1) <b>ğŸŸ¦BacteriağŸŸ¦</b> (Prokaryote)
	2) <b>ğŸŸ¦ArchaeağŸŸ¦</b> (Prokaryote)
	3) <b>ğŸŸ¦EukaryağŸŸ¦</b> (Eukaryotes)
		- Protists
		- Fungi
		- Plants
		- Animals

- Kingdoms:
	- Animalia <b>ğŸŸ¦(Humans belong in this tree of life)ğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Plantae
	- Fungi
	- Protista

- Phylum/Phyla
- Subphylum
- Class
- Order
- Genus/Genera
	- Homo
- Species - 2 Part/Epithet
	- Homo sapiens

## Life at Its Many Levels
1) Biosphere
2) Ecosystems
3) Communities
4) Populations
5) Organisms
6) Organ Systems and Organs
7) Tissues
8) Cells <b>ğŸŸ¦(Properties of life emerge at this level)ğŸŸ¦</b>
9) Organelles
10) Molecules and Atoms

## Major Themes in Biology
- Evolution
- Structure/Function
- Information Flow
- Energy Transformations
- Interconnections within Systems

## The Process of Science
- Two main scientific approaches:
	- <b>ğŸŸ¦Discovery ScienceğŸŸ¦</b> - Describes Nature
	- <b>ğŸŸ¦Hypothesis-driven ScienceğŸŸ¦</b> - Explains Nature

## The Scientific Method
- <b>ğŸŸ¦Scientific MethodğŸŸ¦</b> - A formal process of inquiry
**(Image goes here)**
1) Observation
2) Question
3) Hypothesis
4) Prediction
5) Conduct Experiment 
	- Independent Variable / Experimental Variable
		- Something the researcher manipulates/changes b/c he/she believes it has an effect
	- Dependent Variable / Measured Variable
		- Quotative - Numerical
		- Qualitative - Assessing overall quality
	- Standardized Variable / Constant Variable
		- Stays the same throughout the experiment because we're not investigating that effect
6) Analyze Data
7) Conclusion
8) Report Findings

- Science is about repetition
- The bigger sample size, the more reflective the results are of the entire population, which would be more accurate.
	- Good sample size: 30+

- <b>ğŸŸ¦HypothesisğŸŸ¦</b>: A proposed explanation for a phenomenon or a set of observations.
	- Must be <b>ğŸŸ¦specific, testable, and falsifiableğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Tentative
		- Null Hypothesis (H<sub>o</sub>) - No Effect
		- Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>) -  Has an affect
	- A properly formulated hypothesis leads to a testable <b>ğŸŸ¦predictionğŸŸ¦</b>
	- Written as an "If (BLANK), then (BLANK)" statement

## Proper Experimental Design
1) **Treatment**: Any experimental condition applied to individuals
2) **Experimental Group**: A group of individuals who are exposed to a particular treatment
3) **Control Group**: A group not exposed to the treatment
4) **Variables**: Characteristics of your experimental system that are subject to change.
5) **Replication**: Repeating the experiment to determine the accuracy of the data.

## Controlling Variables
- Minimize differences between a control group and an experimental group other than the treatment itself
- Most important feature of a good experiment
- <b>ğŸŸ¦Independent VariableğŸŸ¦</b>
	- This is what we test
	- What we change or manipulate in the experiment
- <b>ğŸŸ¦Dependent VariableğŸŸ¦</b>
	- This is what changes with the independent variable
	- What we measure

## Test Hypothesis using an ğŸŸ¦ExperimentğŸŸ¦
- An experiment may:
	- Support a hypothesis
	- Refute a Hypothesis
- [<b>ğŸŸ¦Proper Experimental DesignğŸŸ¦</b>](#Proper-Experimental-Design)

## Collect and Analyze Data
- Dependent Variable on <b>ğŸŸ¦y-axisğŸŸ¦</b>
- Independent Variable on <b>ğŸŸ¦x-axisğŸŸ¦</b>

## Theories in Science
- Accumulating facts is not the goal of science
- A <b>ğŸŸ¦theoryğŸŸ¦</b> is comprehensive explanation supported by abundant evidence. Pretty much a hypothesis that has been extensively tested, therefore, ample evidence supports that ideology, hence, it is deemed a theory.
	- Repeatedly tested
	- <b>ğŸŸ¦BroadğŸŸ¦</b> in scope than hypothesis
	- General enough to spin off new hypothesis
- Scientific Theories:
	- Atomic Theory
	- Gravitational Theory
	- **Cell Theory**
	- **Evolutionary Theory**
