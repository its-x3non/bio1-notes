# Chapter 2 - Essential Chemistry for Biology

**ğŸŸ¦(text)ğŸŸ¦** = Important

## Some Basic Chemistry
- **ğŸŸ¦MatterğŸŸ¦**: Anything that occupies space and has mass.
	- Three states: Solid, Liquid, and Gas
	- Compromised of **ğŸŸ¦elementsğŸŸ¦** -> substances that cannot be broken down into other substance.
		- All living things share these elements n varying proportion:
			1) **S**ulphor
			2) **P**hosphorus
			3) **O**xygen
			4) **N**itrogen
			5) **C**arbon
			6) **H**ydrogen
- 25 essential elements
- Four elements make up about 96% of the weight of most cells: 
	1) **ğŸŸ¦OxygenğŸŸ¦**
	2) **ğŸŸ¦CarbonğŸŸ¦**
	3) **ğŸŸ¦HydrogenğŸŸ¦**
	4) **ğŸŸ¦NitrogenğŸŸ¦**
- **ğŸŸ¦Trace ElementsğŸŸ¦**: required in very small amounts.

## Atoms
- Each element consists of <u>one kind</u> of **ğŸŸ¦atomğŸŸ¦** -> the smallest unit of matter that still retains its chemical properties.

## Basic Structure of an Atom
- Atoms are composed of three <u>subatomic particles</u>:
	- **ğŸŸ¦Protons (Positive Charge)ğŸŸ¦** - Found in the **nucleus**
	- **ğŸŸ¦Neutrons (Electrically Neutral)ğŸŸ¦** - Found in the **nucleus**
	- **ğŸŸ¦Electrons (Negative Charge)ğŸŸ¦** - Found in the **Electron Cloud**
- **Elements** are composed of **ğŸŸ¦atomsğŸŸ¦** that differ in the number of **ğŸŸ¦subatomic particlesğŸŸ¦**.

- An atom is characterized by:
	- **ğŸŸ¦Atomic NumberğŸŸ¦**: the number of **ğŸŸ¦ProtonsğŸŸ¦**
	- **ğŸŸ¦Mass NumbersğŸŸ¦**: Sum of the number of **ğŸŸ¦Protons plus neutronsğŸŸ¦**
		- Proton - 1 Dalton
		- Neutron - 1 Dalton
		- Electron - Negligible
	- <u>Carbon Atom:</u>
		- **ğŸŸ¦Atomic NumberğŸŸ¦**: 6
		- **ğŸŸ¦Mass NumberğŸŸ¦**: 12

### Practice
- The element aluminum has an atomic number of 13 and an atomic mass of 26. Determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an aluminum atom?
	- **ğŸŸ¦ProtonsğŸŸ¦**: 13
	- **ğŸŸ¦NeutronsğŸŸ¦**: 13
	- **ğŸŸ¦ElectronsğŸŸ¦**: 13

## Isotopes
- **Isotopes** alternate mass forms of an element
	- Same number of protons and electrons but differ in their number of**ğŸŸ¦neutronsğŸŸ¦.**
	- *What happens to the atomic mass of isotopes?*
**(TABLE 2.1)**

## Isotopes in Biology
- **Radioactive Isotopes**
	- Nucleus is unstable.
	- Nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and energy (radiation).
- Radioactive isotopes can be used for:
	- Carbon dating of fossils
	- Medical imaging (X-rays, CT scans, PET scan, etc.)

## Electrons of an Atom
- **ğŸŸ¦ElectronsğŸŸ¦** contribute to the **volume** of an atom.

## Electron shells
- **ğŸŸ¦Electron ShellsğŸŸ¦** = energy levels within electron cloud.
	- The number of electrons in the **ğŸŸ¦outer electron shellğŸŸ¦** determines how an atom will interact with other atoms.
	- Outer shell wants to be **ğŸŸ¦fullğŸŸ¦** -> stable atom
	- An atom's **ğŸŸ¦electronsğŸŸ¦** determine how the atom will bond with other atom.
### Octet Rule
- 2e - Are stored max in the <u>innermost</u> orbital
- 8e - Are store max in equal subsequent 2nd, 3rd, 4th orbital

## Type of Chemical Bonds
- Atoms lose, gain, or share electrons in order to fill their outermost electron shell -> *chemical bonding* 

1) **Covalent Bonds** - **ğŸŸ¦Sharing of electronsğŸŸ¦** **(IMAGE)**
2) **Ionic Bonds** - **ğŸŸ¦Opposite charges attract -> transfer of electronsğŸŸ¦**  **(IMAGE)**
3) Hydrogen Bond
4) Vander Waal Forces
*(Strongest -> Weakest)*

## Ionic Bonds
- **ğŸŸ¦Ionic BondsğŸŸ¦** are formed between oppositely charged **ğŸŸ¦ionsğŸŸ¦**.
	- **Ion**: an atom with an **ğŸŸ¦electrical chargeğŸŸ¦** due to gain or loss of electron(s).
		- Cat**ion** - Net positive charge
		- An**ion** - Net negative charge
	- Electrically charged ions attract a forming bond
**(IMAGE)**
cat -> an

## Covalent Bonds
- **ğŸŸ¦Covalent BondsğŸŸ¦** form when two atoms <u>share</u> one ore more electrons.
	- Strongest Bond
**(IMAGE)**

### Types of Covalent Bonds
unequal sharing of e-
Example: H2O - Oxygen is highly electronegative, so most e- are gather around oxygen atom

equal sharing of e-
Example: Hydrogen Gas
- **ğŸŸ¦NonpolarğŸŸ¦** covalent bond = **ğŸŸ¦equalğŸŸ¦** sharing of electrons (no charges)
- **ğŸŸ¦PolarğŸŸ¦** covalent bond = **ğŸŸ¦UnequalğŸŸ¦** sharing of electrons (partial charges)
	- Example: **ğŸŸ¦H<sub>2</sub>OğŸŸ¦** (water molecule)

## Electronegativity
- Electrons are not always shared equally.
- **ğŸŸ¦ElectronegativityğŸŸ¦** = an atom's attraction for shared electrons

## Hydrogen Bonds
- The polarity of water molecules results in <u>weak electrical attractions</u> between neighboring water molecules -> **ğŸŸ¦hydrogen bondsğŸŸ¦**
- Important for **life**, as it allows for special properties of water.

## Unique Properties of Water
- Water's unique life supporting properties are due to **ğŸŸ¦hydrogen bondingğŸŸ¦**.
- Four properties of water:
	- The Cohesive nature of Water
	- The ability of water to moderate temperature
	- The biological significance of ice floating
	- The versatility of water as a solvent

### The Cohesion of Water
- Water molecules stick together as a result of hydrogen bonding -> **ğŸŸ¦cohesionğŸŸ¦**
	- Water has an unusually high **surface tension**.
	- Cohesion allows transport of water from the roots to the leaves of plants.

### How Water Moderates Temperature
- Water has a strong **ğŸŸ¦resistance to temperature changeğŸŸ¦** than most other substances.
- Water absorbs and stores large amounts of heat while only changing a few degrees in temperature.
- **ğŸŸ¦Evaporative coolingğŸŸ¦** **(Sweating)**: Occurs when a substance evaporates and the surface of the liquid remaining behind cools down.

### Frozen Water Floats
- When water molecules get cold enough, they move apart, forming ice.
- Ice floats because it is less **ğŸŸ¦denseğŸŸ¦** than liquid water.

### Water as the Solvent of Life
- **ğŸŸ¦SolutionğŸŸ¦**: mixture of two or more substances.
	- The dissolving agent is the **ğŸŸ¦solventğŸŸ¦**.
		- Liquid used to dissolve the substance.
			- Example : Kool-Aid Drink
	- The dissolved substance is the **ğŸŸ¦soluteğŸŸ¦**.
		- Any substance that is dissolvable by liquid.
			- Example: Kool-Aid Powder
- Water is an excellent **ğŸŸ¦solventğŸŸ¦**.
	- Dissolves an enormous variety of solutes necessary for life, providing a medium for chemicals reactions.

## Acids, Bases, and pH
- In a solution, the covalent bond within a water molecule sometimes breaks spontaneously: $$H_2O\longleftrightarrow OH^- + H^+$$ (Water) <-> (Hydroxide) + Hydrogen
- **ğŸŸ¦AcidğŸŸ¦**: a chemical compound that releases H<sup>+</sup> into a solution.
- **ğŸŸ¦BasesğŸŸ¦**: a compound that accepts H<sup>+</sup> and removes them from solution (releases OH instead).
**(IMAGE)**
- **ğŸŸ¦pH ScaleğŸŸ¦**: describes the acidity of a solution.
	- pH of 0 to 6 = acidic
		- More H<sup>+</sup> in solution
		- Low pH #
	- pH 7 = neutral
	- pH of 8 to 14 = basic
		- More OH<sup>-</sup>
		- Less H<sup>+</sup>
		- High pH #
**(REMEMBER TO ADD FIGURE 2.17)**

- **ğŸŸ¦BuffersğŸŸ¦** are substances that minimize changes in pH.
	- <u>accept</u> H<sup>+</sup> ions when they are in <u>excess</u>.
	- <u>donate</u> H<sup>+</sup> ions when they are <u>depleted</u>.
- Organisms use buffers to minimize pH disturbances
	- Human blood at pH 7.4
